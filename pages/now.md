###  Back in London 

Fresh back from Zagreb. I had sampled all the cafes there and I thought it was time to come back to London to sample some cafes here. I bought a new pair of climbing shoes (finally committed) so I am really excited about checking out some sick London gyms soon!

###  Multi-tasking to the extreme

Master's Project: 
Building a multivariate predictive model to help find windier windfarms in Southeast Asia (till end of May)

Active Machine Learning projects:

(1)Computer vision to identify food ingredients and approximate their quantities (think carrots, oinions and garlic)

(2)Implementation of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms on the Physionet phonocardiogram dataset and comparative study of their performance on key features
