This page will not be a wikipedia-like third person narrative of my life events so far but this is an attempt for me to try to condense my life so far into a comprehensive story. Through this, I or the audience you can get a glimpse of my current form of 'what makes me who I am' values and beliefs and understand me as a person. (I try)

I am 23 years old now although my first reaction upon being asked about my age is still 21 and I am enjoying in final year in University of Cambridge. Cambridge is an interesting place, sometiems the academic pressure blinds me from appreaciating that this is a world-class university but when I do pay attention, the beautiful architecture in a pristine sunset can blow me away. How did I get there? How did I become who I am today? Let's start from the top.

I was born in a city called Puyang in Henan province China. Puyang was an industrial city where most of the residents are employees of the two giant oil companies owned by the state. My parents worked in the same company and they met each other in a truely company fashion. In state companies, there is ususally a communist party division nested inside the company and the head of the division has no real power like general manager. One of their little duties often turn out to be introducing young people to each other in the hope of that they will get married. They do this out of two reasons in my belief: first, marriage ensures stability of the young people (or the babies will tie them down?) and second, they are just bored from drinking tea and reading news paper all day. Anyways, that is how my parents met each other. Many of my parents' friends in Puyang settled there forever so I think they were planning to stay there long term as well. Where am I going to be in that case? Will I get stuck in that little city? All of this is about to change because I am going to say goodbye to Puyang.

To be continued...
