This page will not be a wikipedia-like third person narrative of my life events so far but this is an attempt for me to try to condense my life so far into a comprehensive story. Through this, I or the audience you can get a glimpse of my current form of 'what makes me who I am' values and beliefs and understand me as a person. (I try)

I am 23 years old now although my first reaction upon being asked about my age is still 21 and I am enjoying in final year in University of Cambridge. Cambridge is an interesting place, sometiems the academic pressure blinds me from appreaciating that this is a world-class university but when I do pay attention, the beautiful architecture in a pristine sunset can blow me away. How did I get there? How did I become who I am today? Let's start from the top.

I was born in a city called Puyang in Henan province China. Puyang was an industrial city where most of the residents are employees of the two giant oil companies owned by the state. My parents worked in the same company and they met each other in a truely company fashion. In state companies, there is ususally a communist party division nested inside the company and the head of the division has no real power like general manager. One of their little duties often turn out to be introducing young people to each other in the hope of that they will get married. They do this out of two reasons in my belief: first, marriage ensures stability of the young people (or the babies will tie them down?) and second, they are just bored from drinking tea and reading news paper all day. Anyways, that is how my parents met each other. Many of my parents' friends in Puyang settled there forever so I think they were planning to stay there long term as well. But the path for our family took a turn when my dad got bored about his job with the state company where his day-to-day doings involved nothin more than reading newspaper and drinking company tea. He ventured south for new promised opportunity and my mom and I followed suit very shortly after I graduated from Kindergarden. Before my mom took me South, I stayed with my grandparents in the vilage where my dad grew up, Zhaomiao, not very far from the nearby town Fujing in a city called Shenqiu in Henan province. My grandparents still live there now and no doubt the area is one of the poorest area in China and it is also a source of all my dad's inspirational story where he portrayed himself as the village boy fulfiling his Chinese Dream in a big way. Years later, when I sat down before a blank canvas desperately search the 'biggest thing' happened in my life to write for my personal statement for the US university application, I chose that summer as my 'anchoring' point and in many ways that is still true. That summer is the longest I have ever stayed in the village with my grandparents and the result of that was I was covered with Mosquito bites when my mom came to pick me up (you can ask me about my love-hate relationship with Mosquitoes). When I say I can treat the village as part of my 'roots' is also because all the special 'first' experiences in the village that are later blended in my internal narrative or dialogue. I can remember from the top of my head: I stole some sweet potatoes in the filed with my cousins and we cooked them right in the field by dugging a worm like hole with two opennings and putting the sweet potatoes in the flames (a poor man's zero-cost barbecue hole if you are with me); I rode a baby lamb around in my grandparents yard; I attended the local primary school for a couple lessons and the first thing we did in the morning is to clean up our classroom and dumped the pile onto a rubbish mountain right next to the building; I later hid in my grandparents' bedroom every morning from the school teacher who would wheel me to class... I am sure there were tons of more experiences but these are all my memory can render. I have a theory that once you move a place to another, memories associated with the old place will gradually fade away and I cannot remember much of my life from Puyang and the village. s
